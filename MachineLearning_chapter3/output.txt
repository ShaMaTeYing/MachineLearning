Due to its good search ability, GWO has been applied in a various fields. Muangkote et al. (2014) used the GWO with improvements to training q-Gaussian Radial Basis Functional-link nets neural networks. The experimental result indicated that the proposed algorithm obtained competitive performance comparing with other meta-heuristic methods. Komaki and Kayvanfar (2015) successfully applied GWO for the two-stage assembly flow shop scheduling problem with release time to greatly improve the efficiency. Sulaiman et al. (2015) used GWO to solve optimal reactive power dispatch problem. Mirjalili (2015) employed GWO to train multi-layer perceptron and eight standard datasets including five classification and three function-approximation datasets ware evaluated. The results demonstrated that a high level of accuracy in classification and approximation of the proposed trainer could be obtained. However, to the best of our knowledge, the potential of GWO has not been explored to fine tune the optimal parameters appeared in KELM. Therefore, this study aims at exploring the GWO technique's ability to address KELM's model selection problem for classification, and further applying the resulted model GWO-KELM to successfully and effectively predict company bankruptcy. For verification purpose, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed GWO-KELM is compared against the common methods such as grid-search optimized KELM (GSKELM), genetic algorithm optimized KELM (GA-KELM), particle swarm optimization optimized KELM (PSO-KELM) and other four advanced machine learning methods including original ELM, selfadaptive evolutionary extreme learning machine proposed by Cao et al. (2012) (SaE-ELM), SVM and RF on the real-life financial dataset. All methods are compared in terms of the training accuracy, the validation accuracy and test accuracy, Type I error, Type II error and the area under the receive operating characteristic curve (AUC) criterion. For the stability of the results, the cross validation (CV) strategy is also adopted including external 10-fold CV and the inner 5-fold CV. The experimental results show that our proposed methodology, GWO-KELM, performs better when compared with some other well-known common methods. The main contribution of this study can be summarized as follows: a) A new nature-inspired method, GWO is successfully employed to resolve the parameters optimization for KELM for the first time. b) A potential model, GWO-KELM, is successfully applied to bankruptcy prediction with the purpose of being treated as a potential early warning tool for bankruptcy in the financial field. c) The proposed GWO-KELM tends to achieve better classification, and generate more stable and robust results in discriminating the bankrupt companies from the healthy ones when compared to several other methods. The remainder of this paper is structured as following: Section 2 presents a brief description of GWO. Section 3 explains the detailed implementation of the GWO-KELM methodology. In Section 4, the details of the experimental designs are elaborated. The experimental results are presented in Section 5. Conclusions are finally summarized in Section 6.
